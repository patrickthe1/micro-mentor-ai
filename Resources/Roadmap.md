# MICRO-MENTOR AI: COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

## CURRENT STATUS ASSESSMENT
- **Frontend**: Basic React/Tailwind setup with challenge input form, loading state, and advice display
- **Backend**: Very basic API endpoint for generating advice (needs significant improvement)
- **Version Control**: Established with GitHub repository (excluding Resources folder)

## PROJECT DEFINITIONS

**Insight Pathways**: A feature that transforms generic advice into structured, actionable guidance presented as 3-5 sequential steps that build upon each other. Each step includes a clear instruction, brief explanation, and visual indicator of progress, designed to guide users through implementing the advice.

## IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### PHASE 1: BACKEND ENHANCEMENT (2 Weeks)
*Since the backend quality is crucial for the entire application, we'll start here.*

#### Success Metrics for Phase 1:
- Response time under 2 seconds for advice generation
- 90%+ of responses properly formatted with 3-5 clear steps
- API handles all error cases gracefully with appropriate status codes

#### Milestone 1.1: Backend Code Analysis & Planning (3 Days)
- Clone existing backend repository
- Analyze current API implementation and response structure
- Document current limitations and areas for improvement
- Design improved response schema to support Insight Pathways with:
  * A main insight summary (1-2 sentences)
  * 3-5 sequential action steps with titles and descriptions
  * Difficulty indicator for each step (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
  * Estimated time commitment for each step
- Create test suite for evaluating response quality

#### Milestone 1.2: Response Quality Improvement (5 Days)
- Implement enhanced prompt engineering techniques:
  * Use of few-shot examples in prompts
  * Chain-of-thought reasoning to ensure logical step progression
  * Specific formatting instructions with JSON templates
  * Content constraints (e.g., practical advice, actionable steps)
- Add structured formatting for step-by-step insights (3-5 steps)
- Create category-specific prompt templates with domain expertise signals
- Implement response validation to ensure quality based on:
  * Presence of required fields (summary, steps, etc.)
  * Adherence to step count (3-5)
  * Actionability of advice (specific rather than generic)
  * Appropriate length of each section
  * Logical flow between steps
- Add fallback mechanisms for API failures

#### Milestone 1.3: API Expansion (4 Days)

- Frontend project structure is set up for backend integration.

#### Dependencies:
- Requires completion of Milestone 1.2 (Response Quality Improvement) to ensure proper response format for the Insight Pathways display.

#### Milestone 2.1: Define MVP Screens and Information Flow (2 Days)
- Detail the essential screens for the MVP:
    - **Initial Screen/Homepage:** Briefly describe the purpose and key elements (e.g., a welcome message, an input field for the user's challenge, a submit button).
    - **Loading Screen:** Describe what the user will see while the AI is processing (e.g., a simple animation, a message indicating loading).
    - **Insight Pathways Screen:** Detail how the AI-generated advice will be presented, including:
        - Step progression indicators (visual style and placement).
        - How individual steps will be displayed (title, expandable/collapsible description).
        - How difficulty levels will be indicated (color coding or other visual cues).
- Define the user flow: How will the user navigate from the initial screen to the loading screen and then to the Insight Pathways screen?

#### Milestone 2.2: Design in Lovable.dev (4 Days)
- Create a new project in Lovable ([https://lovable.dev/](https://lovable.dev/)).
- Design each of the MVP screens (Initial, Loading, Insight Pathways) within the Lovable project based on the details defined in Milestone 2.1.
- Utilize Lovable's features to create the necessary components for each screen (e.g., input fields, buttons, progress indicators, step lists, expandable sections).
- Define the connections and navigation flow between these screens within the Lovsblr project.
- Experiment with different UI layouts and styles to find a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

#### Milestone 2.3: Migrate Lovable Frontend to Local Environment (1 Day)
- Once the MVP frontend structure and basic design are complete in Lovable, export or copy the generated React code (or the entire project if Lovable allows) into your local development environment where your original frontend project was located (you might consider creating a new branch or a new folder for this Lovable-generated frontend).

#### Milestone 2.4: Integrate Backend with Cursor (3 Days)
- Using Cursor, start integrating the backend functionality with the Lovable-generated frontend:
    - Set up API calls from the frontend to your deployed backend (using the URL for `micro-mentor-ai-backend-v2.onrender.com`).
    - Connect the challenge input field on the initial screen to trigger an API call to the `/api/advice` endpoint.
    - Implement the loading screen to be displayed while waiting for the API response.
    - Parse the structured advice data received from the backend and dynamically render it in the Insight Pathways component.
    - Ensure that the UI elements (step progression, expandable sections, difficulty indicators) are correctly populated with data from the backend.
