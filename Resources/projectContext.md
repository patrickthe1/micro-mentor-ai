# Micro-Mentor AI Project Status
Last updated: March 14, 2025

## Current Status
### Frontend
- Basic React/Tailwind setup is complete
- App is running with a dark-themed UI
- Basic structure resembles the V0 design ![V0](./v0-design.png)
- Components are organized in appropriate folders
- Challenge input, API communication, and advice display are working
- Version control established with GitHub repository

### Backend
- Enhanced API response format is now implemented
- Structured response schema with actionable steps is functioning
- Backend supports categorized advice
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms are in place
- New `/api/categories` endpoint added for category selection
- Successfully migrated from Gemini 1.5 Flash to Gemini 2.0 Flash

## API Updates
### Gemini API Migration (March 14, 2025)
- Successfully migrated from Gemini 1.5 Flash to Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Updated in response to Google's announcement of Gemini 1.5 model discontinuation
- Tested the new integration to ensure compatibility
- No changes to response schema or functionality were required
- Created test script `testGemini2.js` to verify the integration

## Completed Milestones

### Milestone 1.1: Backend Code Analysis & Planning ✅
- Analyzed current API implementation and response structure
- Documented limitations and areas for improvement
- Designed improved response schema to support Insight Pathways
- Created test suite for evaluating response quality

### Milestone 1.2: Response Quality Improvement ✅
- Implemented enhanced prompt engineering techniques:
  * Added detailed formatting instructions with JSON templates
  * Included chain-of-thought reasoning for logical step progression
  * Added specific content constraints for practical, actionable advice
- Created structured response format for step-by-step insights:
  * Each response now includes 3-5 sequential, buildable steps
  * Steps include title, description, difficulty level, and time commitment
  * Optional fields for resources, challenges, and success metrics
- Added category-specific advice capabilities
- Implemented comprehensive response validation:
  * Checks for required fields (category, insight, confidence_score, steps)
  * Validates step count (3-5)
  * Ensures proper data types and value ranges
  * Validates difficulty levels ('beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced')
- Added fallback response mechanism for API failures
- Created test scripts to validate response quality

## Tasks Completed (March 11-14, 2025)

- Create state to track when advice is being fetched
- Show/hide spinner based on loading state

#### Task 5: Create Advice Display Component ✅

- Design a clean container for displaying advice
- Add fade-in animation when advice loads
- Handle empty state appropriately

#### Task 6: Connect Components Together ✅
- Update src/pages/Home.jsx to manage state between components
- Pass props between components as needed
- Implement the advice fetching flow

#### Task 7: Basic Error Handling ✅

- Show user-friendly error messages
- Add retry capability

#### Task 8: Version Control Setup ✅
- Initialize Git repository
- Create .gitignore file for React project
- Connect to GitHub repository
- Make initial commit and push code

### Backend Tasks (March 13-14, 2025)

#### Task 1: Enhance Prompt Engineering ✅
- Redesigned the prompt used for the Gemini API to:
  * Structure responses according to the defined schema
  * Generate 3-5 sequential, actionable steps
  * Include appropriate difficulty levels and time commitments
  * Use a professional mentorship tone
  * Provide proper JSON formatting

#### Task 2: Implement Response Schema ✅
- Updated the API to return responses matching the new schema with:
  * Category classification
  * Concise insight summary
  * Confidence score
  * Structured steps with title, description, difficulty, and time commitment
  * Optional fields (resources, challenges, success metrics)
  * Overall takeaway and related topics

#### Task 3: Add Response Validation ✅
- Created validation functions to ensure:
  * Required fields are present
  * Steps array contains 3-5 items
  * Each step has all required fields
  * Difficulty levels are valid
  * Confidence score is within range

#### Task 4: Implement Fallback Mechanisms ✅
- Added fallback response generation for cases where:
  * The API fails to respond
  * The response doesn't match the expected schema
  * JSON parsing fails

#### Task 5: Add Category Support ✅
- Updated the API to accept an optional category parameter
- Created a new endpoint `/api/categories` to retrieve available categories
- Enhanced the prompt to focus on the specified category

#### Task 6: Create Test Scripts ✅
- Implemented `testResponseSchema.js` to validate the response format
- Created `testApiEndpoint.js` to test the API endpoints

#### Task 7: Gemini API Migration ✅
- Migrated from Gemini 1.5 Flash to Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Updated code comments to document the change
- Tested the integration with the new model
- Created `testGemini2.js` to verify compatibility
